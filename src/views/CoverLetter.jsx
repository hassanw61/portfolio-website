							so for (Frontend)
						</li>
						<p className="font-semibold">Here is a summary of what I have been doing so far in my career:</p>
						<li>
							<span className="font-semibold">React Development:</span>I have been actively involved in developing frontend
							applications using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows to create
							reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of your application.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span className="font-semibold">Component-Based Architecture:</span>I have experienced in building
							applications using a component-based architecture, where the user interface is divided into reusable and
							modular components. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span className="font-semibold">React Ecosystem: </span>I have knowledge and experience with various tools
							and libraries within the React ecosystem. This includes using React Router for client-side routing, Redux or
							React Context for state management, and Axios or Fetch for handling API requests.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span className="font-semibold"> React Hooks </span>I am familiar with React Hooks, introduced in React 16.8,
							which provide a way to use state and other React features without writing class components. Hooks like
							useState and useEffect allows to manage state and perform side effects in functional components.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span className="font-semibold">Responsive Design: </span>I have experience in creating responsive designs
							using React. I know CSS techniques and responsive frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI to ensure that
							your applications adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span className="font-semibold">Testing:</span>I understand the importance of testing in frontend
							development. I have experience with testing frameworks like Jest and Enzyme, writing unit tests, integration
							tests, or end-to-end tests to ensure the quality and reliability of your React applications.
							<li>
								<span className="font-semibold">Deployment:</span>I have experience in deploying web applications. This
								involves tasks such as configuring web servers, deploying code to hosting platforms, setting up CI/CD
								pipelines, and managing the deployment process.
							</li>
							<span className="font-semibold">Continuous Learning: </span> As a frontend developer using React, I actively
							stay updated with the latest features, best practices, and trends in the React ecosystem. I explore new
							libraries, attend conferences, and engage with the React community to enhance my skills and knowledge.
							Overall, My experience as a frontend developer using React showcases my expertise in building reusable and
							modular UI components, managing state effectively, optimizing performance, and staying current with the
							evolving React ecosystem. My skills and dedication to continuous learning make me a valuable asset in
							React-based frontend development projects.
						</li>
						<p className="font-semibold">What Tech Stack I worked on:</p>
						<p>
							I am able to build dynamic and visually appealing web applications using React, structure the content with
							HTML, style it with CSS, and utilize the utility classes provided by Tailwind CSS to expedite the development
							process.
						</p>
						<p className="font-semibold">My tech stack includes:</p>
						<li>
							<span className="font-semibold">React:</span>I have experience working with React, a popular JavaScript
							library for building user interfaces. React allows to create reusable components and manage the state of your
							applications efficiently.
						</li>
						<li>
							<spa className="font-semibold">HTML: </spa>I am proficient in writing HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which
							is used to structure and present content on the web.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span className="font-semibold">CSS: </span>I am experienced and knowledgeable in CSS, which is used to style
							and layout HTML elements, and Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS provides a wide range
							of predefined utility classes for quickly styling components and creating responsive user interfaces
							efficiently. By combining my expertise in CSS and Tailwind CSS, I have the ability to effectively design and
							develop visually appealing and responsive web interfaces.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span className="font-semibold">Redux: </span>I am experienced in using Redux as a predictable state
							container. Redux helps manage the state of your application in a centralized manner, making it easier to
							track and modify state changes throughout your React components.

							Back-End Web Development
						</h1>
						<p>
							Nearly every app I have launched in the past had the back-end done also by me. In order to improve the
							development speed, performance and reliability, I have changed languages and frameworks already multiple
							times, like switching to Node.js, configured servers using just the shell, then Chef/Ansible, and now Docker
							and Kubernetes.
						</p>
						<p>
							The lessons I learned while doing all these apps will be useful for me forever, no matter what framework I
							will use in the next project.
						</p>
						<p>What I can do for you at that side is:</p>

						<li>lead development of backends in Node.js</li>
						<li>splitting the back-end into separate domains and microservices,</li>
						<li>cooperation with APIs, remote data synchronizations, cloud servers, asynchronous workers,</li>
						<li>using different types of databases (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis)</li>
						<li>
							dividing the servers into different machine nodes / docker containers; database sharding; load balancing,
						</li>
						<li>
							refactoring existing applications, by improving code readibility, separating concerns into separate
							functions/classes/modules, taking the business logic out from your request/response layer into separate
							modules (DDD), and moving the app architecture into an event-based one
						</li>
						<li>writing unit and e2e tests</li>

							What About Dev-Ops, Design, UI, Project Leadership, Team Mentorship ?
						</h1>
						<p className="font-semibold">During my time I have created and released tens of websites.</p>
						<p>
							Thus, not only I have coded their back-end and front-end codebases, but often I also had to care about other
							things needed in a successful web application project:
						</p>

						<li>good planning of UI and thinking how it affects the UX;</li>
						<li>consistency in design and typography;</li>
						<li>consistency in design and typography;</li>
						<li>launching, deployment and monitoring the app after the release;</li>
						<li>recruiting, onboarding and mentoring team members;</li>
						<li>
							in cases where a good Project Manager was missing, fullfilling his role, in order to save the project from
							losing time on unneeded things.
						</li>
